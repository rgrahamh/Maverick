# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build
  - test
  - containerization

build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - ./build/compile.sh all
    - echo "Compile complete."

unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
    - cd bin/Test
    - find Test* | xargs -I {} bash -c "./{}"
    - cd -
    - echo "Unit tests finished!"

code-analysis-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
  script:
    - echo "Doing static code analysis..."
    - sleep 10
    - echo "No issues found."

deploy-job:      # This job runs in the deploy stage.
  stage: containerization  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Building the Docker container"
    - echo "Container built"
